Peer:
  server.run
    listening --> new client
      new uploader obj
        new file manager obj
          gets block from age.text
      block = message.piece 
      uploader.send block
  tracker.run
    ping
      broadcast its ID
    listener
      gets ping
        has <id> <ip> <port> of other peer
        add to table
  connect(<ip>, <port>) "clients"
    creates client object
      connects to ip:port
      new downloader obj
      recieve block
        do something with downloader obj

This is what i gathered from the end of last class.
I just dont know how tracker triggers peer to call connect_to_peers
